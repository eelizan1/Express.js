which is a URI (or path) and a specific HTTP request method (GET, POST, and so on).

app.METHOD(PATH, HANDLER)

app is an instance of express.
METHOD is an HTTP request method, in lowercase.
PATH is a path on the server.
HANDLER is the function executed when the route is matched.

'/' represents the home page followed by a call back function
